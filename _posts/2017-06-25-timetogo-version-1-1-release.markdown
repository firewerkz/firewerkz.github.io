So today version 1.1 of TimeToGo, TtG, was approved and released. I hope you enjoy the added capability of having the dates in the correct format for your device locale.

[Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) continues to make the process of test and development, as well as app screenshot capture and formatting a breeze. If you haven't used it, I can thoroughly recommend it.

All the best, Dick.
