I know TimeToGo has only just been released, but I've been working on the next version, which is now in review. This version display's the dates and date picker in the correct format for the device's locale setting.

As I'd been working on all the other things needed for the App Store release, I wanted to get the first working version reviewed and released, and then to develop the functionality further, to make the app more useful for more people.

I've also been learning about, and using the brilliant [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) tools, which save an amazing amount of time by automating all the other stuff that you need to do, in addition to the fun of actual app development.

I hope you find the updated version useful when it's approved and released.

All the best, Dick.
