I know TimeToGo has only just been released, but I've been working on the next version, which is now in review. This display's the dates and date picker in the correct format for the device locale setting.

I'd been working on all the things needed for the App Store release that I wanted to get the first working version released and then develop the functionality further, to make it more useful for more people.

I've also be learning about, and used the brilliant [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) tools, which save an amazing amount of time by automating all the other stuff that you need to do, beyond the fun of app development.

I hope you find the updated version useful when it's approved and released.

All the best, Dick.
